# CS305_Practices_for_Secure_Software_Report
Project Two



Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

   Artemis Financial is an established financial institutions looking to mordernize and expand it online presence.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

   I feel i did the whole project well. I was able to minimze new vulnerabilities while making the source code more secure in a variety of ways. Coding securely is of great importance because secure code protects data and processes which benefits both the service provider and their customers.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

  Figuring out which vulnerabilities were false positives and should be suppressed was a little dificult at first but grew easier with practice.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

  We increased security by adding checksums and certificates and changing to HTTPS protocol. Maven is a very powerful tool for assessing vulnerabilities and is something i plan to use more of in the future.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  Manually reviewing the code in addition to the vulnerability assesment helped to ensure the code was both functional and secure. After refectoring code, running the vulnerability assesment again helped to track that no new vulnerabilities were added.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  Maven was a very helpful tool. Also, the practice of reiterating through the code and making changes incrementally was very helpful.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  I would use this project to demonstrate my familiarity with generating checksums, certificates, and security practices in web development.
